What matters most to me (as an artist) is making sure that my audience (of any age) is prompted to think about the subject matter I presented on a deeper level. Whether my work displays three dimensional concepts, videography or various forms of digital fabrication through a series of colors or is a composition that incorporates the elements of texture, lines and contrasting hues, I aspire to evoke deeper thinking on underlying issues within our community. The subject matters that I prefer to tackle are issues concerning; identity, current social, ethical or political affairs and interpretation of current issues or crises. What urges me to create art are the injustices that happen in our world. On social media the event may be discussed for ​​promoted through a series of hashtags and Instagram posts for about a week until the “trend” stops. Although the social media trend is over, the issue is still very prevalent in today's society. We may have stopped posting about it but parents are still grieving and innocent people are still dying everyday because of issues that aren’t promoted or talked about enough. When I think about what I can do to make a difference or raise awareness about an issue I look to art as my outlet. 
	I view art as a universal language that is interpreted in infinite ways. While my pieces may have been created as a form of self expression others will view my art with a different perspective, one that may enlighten them, inspire them or anger them. The emotions that I evoke through my pieces are appreciated but irrelevant in comparison to the conversations that I desire to take place because social and self awareness is what I want my audience to experience and engage in.
I had my first interaction with the art medium when I was 10. I loved to sketch characters and whimsical environments for these characters to exist in. Years later, I was introduced to the digital art world and made this space my home when I was going through my self discovery process in the midst of a global pandemic. 
Throughout the course of my life I have always struggled with self acceptance. I constantly questioned myself saying and thinking, “am I good enough”, “why don’t I fit in” and more commonly “why am I here?” and I still ask myself these questions. Even though self love is a never ending journey with yourself I would like to promote self love despite the season that you are in to the best of my ability. Especially on a digital forum. These days on social media there are multiple segways to destroy your self esteem constantly and I want to promote the opposite. Initially I engaged in digital media art to create art that promotes self love, equality and humanity. Now, I aspire to promote inclusivity, self acceptance, and social awareness. When people view my art (whether they like it or not) I hope that conversations are started about issues that are worth being discussed.
